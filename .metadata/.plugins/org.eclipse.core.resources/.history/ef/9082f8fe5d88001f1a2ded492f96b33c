//	The onLoad() method in Hibernate Interceptors is used to hook into the process of loading entities from the database. 4
//	It allows you to perform custom actions whenever an entity is loaded,
//	means --while getting data , before this method will invoke and we can modify the data before display 
//	for sensitive data --we can mask it before displaying the data
@Override
public boolean onLoad(Object entity, Serializable id, Object[] state, String[] propertyNames, Type[] types) {
	
	return super.onLoad(entity, id, state, propertyNames, types);
}

//   ---------------  Parameters -------------
//entity       : The entity instance that is being loaded from the database. This is the actual object that Hibernate will return to your application.
//id           : The identifier of the entity being loaded. This is the primary key value that uniquely identifies the entity.
//state        : An array of the current state values of the entity. This contains the values of the properties of the entity as they exist in the database.
//propertyNames: An array of the names of the properties corresponding to the values in the state array.

// --------   How It Works in Practice   --------------
//Entity Loading: Whenever an entity is loaded from the database (e.g., via session.get(MyEntity.class, id)), the onLoad() method is called.
//Modification  : If the entity matches specific criteria (like being an instance of MyEntity), 
//                you can modify its state directly before it is returned to the application.
