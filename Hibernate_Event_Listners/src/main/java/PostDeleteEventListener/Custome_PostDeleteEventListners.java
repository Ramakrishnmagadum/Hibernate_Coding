//The PostDeleteEventListener in Hibernate is an interface that allows you to react to the event that occurs immediately after an entity 
//has been deleted from the database.

//	   ------  Purpose of requiresPostCommitHandling  -------
//Transaction Boundaries: This method indicates whether the operations performed by the listener depend on the successful commit of the transaction. 
//	              If you return true, it means the listener's actions should only take place after the transaction has been successfully committed.
//
//Data Integrity: Returning true helps ensure that any actions that depend on the integrity of the data (e.g., sending notifications, updating related 
//	              entities, or external systems) are only executed after confirming that the delete operation was successful and the data is consistent.
//
//Performance Optimization:If the actions in the listener do not depend on the transaction's success (e.g., logging or simple state updates), returning 
//	               false allows for immediate processing, which can enhance performance by reducing waiting times associated with transaction commits.
	@Override
	public boolean requiresPostCommitHanding(EntityPersister persister) {
		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
		return false;
	}

	@Override
	public void onPostDelete(PostDeleteEvent event) {
		System.out.println("post delete operation executing.......");
		
	}
}
//    ----------  Example Scenarios  ------------
//Return true: If your listener sends a message to another service that depends on the entity being successfully deleted, you would return true. 
//               This ensures that the message is sent only after the transaction is committed.
//@Override
//public boolean requiresPostCommitHandling(EntityPersister persister) {
//    return true; // Ensure this runs after commit for consistency
//}


//Return false: If your listener simply logs the deletion or performs a lightweight operation that does not rely on the transaction being committed, 
//                you would return false.
//@Override
//public boolean requiresPostCommitHandling(EntityPersister persister) {
//    return false; // Safe to execute immediately
//}
